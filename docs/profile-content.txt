FULL DESCRIPTION:
IQ Auto Deals is an online used car marketplace that connects car buyers with certified dealers across the United States. The platform enables customers to browse thousands of quality pre-owned vehicles from local dealers within 50 miles of their location.

The company differentiates itself through its unique dealer competition model. When a buyer selects up to 4 vehicles they're interested in and submits a "deal request," multiple dealers can submit competitive offers for those vehicles. Buyers can receive up to 3 offers per car, ensuring they get the best possible price without visiting multiple dealerships.

For car buyers, the platform is completely free to use with no fees, membership costs, or obligations. Buyers typically save $1,500 to $5,000 compared to traditional dealership prices by leveraging dealer competition.

For auto dealers, IQ Auto Deals provides access to pre-qualified, motivated buyers actively shopping for vehicles. The platform offers a 90-day free trial for new dealer accounts, followed by flexible Silver, Gold, and Platinum packages with no additional fees for leads or completed sales.
