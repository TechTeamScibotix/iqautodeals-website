   - Click-through rate (CTR)
   - Average position
   - Pages indexed

2. **Google Analytics**
   - Organic traffic by city/state

## Competitive Advantage

### Why This Works

Most used car platforms target:

- Single city/region only (limited reach)
- Brand-specific terms only

**IQ Auto Deals is now positioned to:**
- Capture local search intent (lower competition)
- Compete in 50+ markets simultaneously (massive reach)
- Build authority across entire nation (brand power)

### Defensibility

Once rankings are established:
- Very difficult for competitors to displace
- Compounding effect (better rankings → more traffic → more trust → even better rankings)
- Local citations and backlinks create moat
